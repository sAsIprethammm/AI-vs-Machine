# 🧠 AI vs 🤖 Machine

An interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors simulation that **teaches the difference between Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** — with just one Colab notebook.

---

## 🎯 Concept

Most people use “AI” and “ML” interchangeably. This project clears up the confusion through gameplay.

We simulate **100 rounds** of Rock-Paper-Scissors using various AI-style and ML-style strategies to show:

- 🤖 **AI** = programmed intelligence (no learning)
- 📈 **Machine Learning** = adaptive, learns from patterns

---

## 🧪 What's Inside?

This project uses **only one file: `ai_vs_machine.ipynb`**

Inside, you’ll find:

- ✅ 10 unique strategies (rule-based and learning-based)
- ✅ A full 100-round simulation
- ✅ Win/loss/draw tracking
- ✅ Strategy performance stats
- ✅ Final verdict: Brain 🧠 or Machine 🤖?

## 🤖 Strategies Used

| Category | Strategy             | Description                              |
|----------|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| AI       | Always Rock          | Always throws Rock                       |
| AI       | Random               | Purely random moves                      |
| AI       | Frequency Counter    | Counters your most common move           |
| AI       | Markov Chain         | Predicts next move based on transitions  |
| AI       | Bluffing Strategy    | Alternates to confuse and bait           |
| ML       | RNN (LSTM) Predictor | Learns move sequences to predict yours   |
| ML       | Pattern Learner      | Detects and counters move patterns       |
| ML       | Meta-Strategy        | Picks best strategy adaptively           |
| ML       | History Window Learner | Uses recent history to train prediction|
| ML       | Strategy Voting      | Combines all models to pick a winner     |

## 🎮 How It Works

1. Each strategy plays **10 rounds** (total = 100 rounds)
2. User moves are simulated
3. All outcomes are logged
4. Final score is announced
5. Charts and summary tables show which side won

---

## 🚀 To Run

- Open [`ai_vs_machine.ipynb`](./ai_vs_machine.ipynb) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Run all cells (✅ includes training + simulation)
- View live stats and the winner announcement
- Final CSV log is saved in the same directory

---

## 💡 Learning Outcome

- Understand how **AI behaves rigidly**, while **ML adapts**
- Learn how strategy and data change game outcomes
- See how models like RNNs actually learn patterns
